## Hi, nice to meet you

I'm Ishita - a MAPSS student in the psychology concentration. I'll be studying remotely this quarter from my hometown in India. 

### Here are some things about me - 
* I love reading. This past summer, I've rediscovered my love for fiction.
  * I recently read *Anxious People* by Fredrik Backman, and it's the best book I've read this year. I highly recommend it. [*(goodreads link)*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49127718-anxious-people)

* Although I find myself fascinated by practically the entirety of psychological research, particularly social psychology, my two main areas of research interest are - 
  * Prosocial Behaviour and intergroup helping
  * Meaning and well-being
  
* I really enjoy travelling, so I'm very excited to explore Chicago next year!

* I **love** Avatar: The Last Airbender. 

* Here is what the view outside my window looks like right now -
